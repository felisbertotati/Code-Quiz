# Code-Quiz

## Decription

In this project I had to create a multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of the high scores and initials. Based on that I have to use the following instructions to build the quiz:

* When user clicks on the button to start the time and it will present the questions;
* User will answer the question and it will present the next question;
* When user answers a question incorrectly it will subtract from the clock time;
* Game finishes when the user answers all the questions or the timer reaches 0;
* User can save the initials and score.
