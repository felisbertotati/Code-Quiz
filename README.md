# Code-Quiz

## Decription

In this project I had to create a multiple-choice coding quiz such can keep track the high scores and initials. Based on that I have to follow up the following instructions:

* When user click in the button to start the time starts and it will present with questions;
* User will answer the question and it will present the next question;
* When user answer a question incorrectly it will subctrat from the clock time;
* Game finish when user answer all the questions or the timer reaches 0;
* User can save the initials and score.
